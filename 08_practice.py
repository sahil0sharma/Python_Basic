# 1. Write a Python program that defines a user-defined function to calculate the factorial of a 
# given positive integer. The program should take an integer as input and print the factorial of 
# that number using the defined function. 





# 2. Write a Python program that takes a list of integers as input and demonstrates the use of 
# various built-in functions such as sum(), max(), min(), and sorted(). Display the results of 
# these operations. 
# 3. Write a Python program that defines a recursive function to generate the nth Fibonacci 
# number. The program should take an integer n as input and print the nth Fibonacci number 
# using the defined recursive function. 
# 4. Write a Python program that defines two functions: one for squaring a number and another 
# for cubing a number. Use a higher-order function that takes a list of numbers and a function 
# (either the squaring or cubing function) as arguments, and returns a new list with the function 
# applied to each element of the input list. Demonstrate the use of this higher-order function 
# with both squaring and cubing functions. 
# 5. Write a Python program that takes a list of integers and a threshold value as input. Use a 
# lambda function combined with the filter() function to create a new list containing only the 
# numbers greater than the threshold value. Display the new list.
